The last diff indicates that the first migration file contains placeholder values instead of the user's UID. The user provided their UID, and another AI suggested creating a migration to insert it along with the email from auth.users. There's a file created in supabase/migrations that isn’t shown in the diff. I need to execute the SQL using a <lov-sql> block to insert into admin_users, but I lack the email since the user only provided the UID. The prior plan involved selecting from auth.users to retrieve the email. Also, we might need to consider the unique user_id constraint, but I need to check the table schema for admin_users." duration="3.311228">

<lov-tool-use id="thinking-6bec934f-10e5-45ef-a39e-600703dbd14a" name="lov-think" data="**Defining SQL for admin_users**

I see that the AdminUser interface defines fields like id, user_id, email, role, created_at, and updated_at. It seems that admin_users likely has a unique user_id and maybe row-level security (RLS). My plan is to use an \"insert ... on conflict\" statement to update the email and role if a conflict occurs. However, it’s safer to delete any existing rows for the user_id and then insert, but upsert could work better if the unique constraint exists. 

I’ll construct the SQL to insert into admin_users from auth.users using the user_id and email. Since I need to use <lov-sql>, I’ll keep it to that without mixing in <lov-code>." duration="2.881558">

After running the SQL, I need to confirm that the changes haven't been applied yet using the \"user-just-ran-migration\" helper. It instructs me to check if the necessary changes are present; if they are, I should inform the user, and if not, proceed. Since we’re running the SQL now, I can later instruct the user to log out and log back in, then visit /admin. It's important to ensure the SQL references the schema correctly, as we can't modify read-only files. I realize the admin_users table should already exist." duration="14.043456">

<lov-tool-use id="thinking-d6800411-8ae7-4a64-b062-34edcdf146de" name="lov-think" data="**Preparing SQL for insertion**

I need to include a \"create table if not exists\" clause, but that might conflict with existing migrations. The user only asked for an insertion, so I'll go with an upsert strategy. To handle email retrieval, I'll select from auth.users to get the necessary email. The SQL will look something like this:

```sql
insert into public.admin_users (user_id, email, role)
select u.id, coalesce(u.email, '') as email, 'admin'
from auth.users u
where u.id = 'uuid'::uuid
on conflict (user_id) do update set email = excluded.email, role = excluded.role, updated_at = now();
```

I’ll also ensure the created_at field sets to the current time automatically. After running this, I plan to instruct the user to refresh their session. I just need to remember to keep everything concise and formatted correctly using the <lov-sql> block for execution." duration="2.242661">
